  <summary>GRASS GIS, the Open Source Geographic Information System</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
    The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System 
    (http://grass.osgeo.org/), commonly referred to as GRASS GIS, is 
    an Open Source Geographic Information System providing powerful 
    raster, vector and geospatial processing capabilities in a single 
    integrated software suite.
    </p>
    <p>
    GRASS GIS includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of 
    raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, 
    and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery. It also 
    provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation 
    graphics and hardcopy maps.
    </p>
    <p>
    GRASS GIS has been translated into about twenty languages and 
    supports a huge array of data formats. It can be used either as a 
    stand-alone application or as backend for other software packages 
    such as QGIS and R geostatistics. It is distributed freely under 
    the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). GRASS GIS is a 
    founding member of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

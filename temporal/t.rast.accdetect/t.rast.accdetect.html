<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>t.rast.accdetect</b> is designed to detect accumulation pattern in 
temporally accumulated space time raster datasets created by
<a href="t.rast.accumulate.html">t.rast.accumulate</a>.

This module expects a space time raster dataset as input that is the result 
of a <a href="t.rast.accumulate.html">t.rast.accumulate</a> run.
<p>
The <b>start</b> time and the <b>end</b> time of the pattern detection 
process must be set, eg. <b>start="2000-03-01" end="2011-01-01"</b>. 
The <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> time do not need to be the same as for 
the accumulation run that produced the input space time raster dataset. 
In addition a <b>cycle</b>, eg. "8 months", can be specified, that 
defines after which time interval the accumulation pattern detection 
process restarts. The <b>offset</b> option specifies the time between 
two cycles that should be skipped, eg. "4 months". Please make sure 
that the <b>cycle</b> and <b>offset</b> options are same as in the 
accumulation process that produces the input space time raster dataset, 
otherwise the accumulation pattern detection will produce wrong 
results.
<p>
The <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> values of the pattern detection 
process can be set, either by using space time raster datasets or 
by using fixed values for all raster cells and time steps. 
<p>
Using space time raster datasets allow to specify minimum and maximum 
values for each raster cell and each time step. For example, we want to 
detect the germination (minimum value) and harvesting (maximum value) 
dates for different crops in Germany using the growing-degree-day (GDD) 
method for several years. Different crops may grow in different raster 
cells and change with time because of crop rotation. Hence we need to 
specify different GDD germination/harvesting (minimum/maximum) values 
for different raster cells and different years.
<p>
The raster maps that specifies the minimum and maximum values of the 
actual granule will be detected using the following temporal relations: 
equals, during, overlaps, overlapped and contains. First all maps with 
equal time stamps to the current granule of the input STRDS will be 
detected, the first minimum map and the first maximum map that were 
found are used as range definitions. If no equal maps are found then 
maps with a temporal during relation are detected, then maps that 
temporally overlap the actual granules, until maps are detected that 
have a temporal contain relation. If no maps are found or 
minimum/maximum STRDS are not set, then the <b>range</b> option is 
used, eg. <b>range=480,730</b>.
<p>
The <b>base</b> name of of the generated maps must always be set.
<p>
This module produces two output space time raster datasets. The 
<b>occurrence</b> output STRDS stores the time in days from the begin 
of a cycle for each raster cell and time step that has a value within 
the minimum and maximum definition. These values can be used to compute 
the duration of the recognized accumulation pattern. The 
<b>indicator</b> output STRDS uses three values, that can be set using 
the <b>staend</b> option, to mark raster cells with integer values that 
indicate the start, the intermediate state and the end of a 
accumulation pattern. As default specifies the value 1 the start, the 
value 2 the intermediate state and the value 3 the end of the 
accumulation pattern in a cycle.

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.distance</em> finds the nearest element in set <em>to</em> 
for every point in set <em>from</em>. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

These two sets are given by the respective <b>layer</b>, <b>where</b>
and <b>cats</b> parameters. The type of <em>to</em> features is 
specified by <b>to_type</b> parameter. All <em>from</em> features 
are <em>points</em>. A table is linked to <b>output</b> map 
containing various information about the relation. More 
specifically, the table has three columns: <em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em>
and <em>dist</em> storing category of each <em>from</em> 
feature, category of the nearest <em>to</em> feature and the 
distance between them respectively. Furthemore, <b>output</b> map 
contains the shorest path between each <em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em> 
pair. Each path consist of several lines. If a line is on the 
shorest path from a point then the category of this point is 
assigned to the line. Note that every line may contain more than one 
category value since a single line may be on the shortest path for 
more than one <em>from</em> feature. And so the shortest paths can 
be easily obtained by querying lines with corresponding category 
number.
<br>
The costs of arcs in forward and backward direction are specified by 
<b>arc_column</b> and <b>arc_backward_column</b> columns respectively. If
<b>arc_backward_column</b> is not given, the same cost is used in both directions.  
<p>
<em>v.net.distance</em> will not work if you are trying to find the 
nearest neighbors within a group of nodes, i.e. where <em>to</em> 
and <em>from</em> are the same set of nodes, as the closest node 
will be the node itself and the result will be zero-length paths. In 
order to find nearest neighbors within a group of nodes, you can 
either loop through each node as <em>to</em> and all other nodes as 
<em>from</em> or create a complete distance matrix with
<a href="v.net.allpairs.html">v.net.allpairs</a> and select the
lowest non-zero distance for each node.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Find shortest path and distance from every school to the nearest hospital 
and show all paths.

<p>
Streets are grey lines, schools are green circles, hospitals are red 
crosses, shortest paths are blue lines:

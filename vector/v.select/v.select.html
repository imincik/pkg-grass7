<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.select</em> allows the user to select features from a vector 
map by features from another one.

<p>Supported operators (without GEOS):
<ul>
  <li><b>overlap</b> - features partially or completely overlap
</ul>

Supported operators (with GEOS):
<ul>
  <li><b>equals</b> - features are spatially equals</li>
  <li><b>disjoint</b> - features do not spatially intersect</li>
  <li><b>intersects</b> - features spatially intersect</li>
  <li><b>touches</b> - features spatially touches</li>
  <li><b>crosses</b> - features spatially crosses</li>
  <li><b>within</b> - feature A is completely inside feature B</li>
  <li><b>contains</b> - feature B is completely inside feature A</li>
  <li><b>overlaps</b> - features spatially overlap</li>
  <li><b>relate</b> - feature A is spatially related to feature B</li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Only features with category numbers will be considered. If required
the <em><a href="v.category.html">v.category</a></em> module can be
used to add them. Typically boundaries do not need to be given a
category number, as an area's attributes are inherited from the
centroid. Typically points, lines, and centroids will always want to
have a cat number. E.g. take a road which separates two farms. It is
ambiguous as to which farm an attribute that is attached to the road
belongs to. The boundary only needs a cat number if it will hold its
own attributes, such as road name or pavement form. A centroid in each
paddock holds the information with respect to ownership, area, etc.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Extract fire stations (points) falling into urban area (polygon) - North Carolina
data set (point in polygon test):

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=firestations binput=urbanarea output=urban_firestations \
         operator=overlap
</pre></div>

Extract railroad lines from zip code map overlapping with the urban area
(line in polygon test):

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=railroads binput=urbanarea \
         output=railroads_in_urbanarea operator=overlap
</pre></div>

Extract those areas from zip code map which overlap with railroads
(polygon on line test):

<div class="code"><pre>
# first add a tiny buffer around railroad lines:
v.buffer input=railroads output=railroads_buf20m \
  distance=20

v.select ainput=zipcodes_wake binput=railroads_buf20m \
  output=zipcodes_wake_railroads operator=overlap
</pre></div>

<h2>TODO</h2>
 
Processing areas with GEOS is currently incredibly slow. Significant
speed-up is desired.

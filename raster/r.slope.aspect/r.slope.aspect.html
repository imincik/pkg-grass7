<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.slope.aspect</em> generates raster maps of slope, aspect, curvatures and
first and second order partial derivatives from a raster map of true
elevation values. The user must specify the input <b>elevation</b> raster map
and at least one output raster maps. The user can also specify the
<b>format</b> for slope (degrees, percent; default=degrees), and the 
<b>zscale</b>: multiplicative factor to convert elevation units to horizontal units;
(default 1.0).

<p>
The <b>elevation</b> input raster map specified by the user must contain true
elevation values, <em>not</em> rescaled or categorized data. If the elevation
values are in other units than in the horizontal units,
they must be converted to horizontal units using the parameter <b>zscale</b>.
<em>In GRASS GIS 7, vertical units are not assumed to be meters any more.
For example, if both your vertical and horizontal units are feet,
parameter <b>zscale</b> must not be used</em>.

<p>
The <b>aspect</b> output raster map indicates the direction that slopes are
facing. The aspect categories represent the number degrees of east. Category
and color table files are also generated for the aspect raster map. The aspect
categories represent the number degrees of east and they increase
counterclockwise: 90 degrees is North, 180 is West, 270 is South 360 is East.

<p>
The aspect is not defined for slope equal to zero.
Thus, most cells with a very small slope end up having category 0,
45, ..., 360 in <b>aspect</b> output.
It is possible to reduce the bias in these directions
by filtering out the aspect in areas where the terrain is almost flat.
A option <b>min_slope</b> can be used to specify the minimum slope
for which aspect is computed. The aspect for all cells with
slope&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<b>min_slope</b> is set to <i>null</i> (no-data).

<p>
The <b>slope</b> output raster map contains slope values, stated in degrees of
inclination from the horizontal if <b>format</b>=degrees option (the default)
is chosen, and in percent rise if <b>format</b>=percent option is chosen.
Category and color table files are generated.

<p>
Profile and tangential curvatures are the curvatures in the direction of
steepest slope and in the direction of the contour tangent respectively. The
curvatures are expressed as 1/metres, e.g. a curvature of 0.05 corresponds to a
radius of curvature of 20m. Convex form values are positive and concave form values
are negative.

<p>For some applications, the user will wish to use a reclassified raster map
of slope that groups slope values into ranges of slope. This can be done using
<em><a href="r.reclass.html">r.reclass</a></em>. An example of a useful
reclassification is given below:
<div class="code"><pre>          category      range   category labels
                     (in degrees)    (in percent)

             1         0-  1             0-  2%
             2         2-  3             3-  5%
             3         4-  5             6- 10%
             4         6-  8            11- 15%
             5         9- 11            16- 20%
             6        12- 14            21- 25%
             7        15- 90            26% and higher

     The following color table works well with the above
     reclassification.

             2         0    153       0
             3       128    153       0
             4       204    179       0
             5       128     51      51
             6       255      0       0
             7         0      0       0</pre></div>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

To ensure that the raster elevation map is not inappropriately resampled,
the settings for the current region are modified slightly (for the execution
of the program only): the resolution is set to match the resolution of
the elevation raster map and the edges of the region (i.e. the north, south, east
and west) are shifted, if necessary, to line up along edges of the nearest
cells in the elevation map. If the user really wants the raster elevation map
resampled to the current region resolution, the <b>-a</b> flag should be specified.

<p>
The current mask is ignored.

<p>
The algorithm used to determine slope and aspect uses a 3x3 neighborhood
around each cell in the raster elevation map. Thus, it is not possible to determine
slope and aspect for the cells adjacent to the edges in the elevation map
layer. These cells are assigned a "zero slope" value (category 0) in both
the slope and aspect raster maps.

<p>
Horn's formula is used to find the first order derivatives in x and y directions.

<p>
Only when using integer elevation models, the aspect is biased in 0,
45, 90, 180, 225, 270, 315, and 360 directions; i.e., the distribution
of aspect categories is very uneven, with peaks at 0, 45,..., 360 categories.
When working with floating point elevation models, no such aspect bias occurs.
